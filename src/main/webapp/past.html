    <div><em><strong>Green Umbrella Software</strong></em> was pivotal in the development of a multi-int 
    software suite that streamlined and enhanced analytical work all over the world.  
    Currently this software package is operational and has not had an update or outage since 2007.  
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    Green Umbrella Software developed parsing algorithms for extracting various information 
    from free text.  We developed data mining tools to provide undiscovered connections between 
    information and display that information to the end user.  We supported numerous end user 
    organizations with real time technical support and desired software enhancements.  
    Green Umbrella Software's time management and requirement analysis skills were drastically 
    expanded during the time on this contract.  
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    Green Umbrella Software was part of the Team of the Quarter in quarter two of fiscal year 
    2003 for their outstanding performance on this contract.  Also due to his outstanding 
    performance on the development and support of this software package, Green Umbrella 
    Software's president was selected by the program manager to meet President George W. Bush. </div>
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    <div>Green Umbrella Software was part of a team that developed a multi-modal biometric Service 
    Oriented Architecture (SOA) web application that was managed using the Agile methodology.  
    Green Umbrella Software developed a user friendly side-by-side comparison utility to allow 
    end user the ability to compare and adjudicate potential matches.  Green Umbrella Software 
    implemented an audit Application Programming Interface (API) to be used in either a synchronous 
    or asynchronous fashion throughout the application.  Our firm was responsible for writing the 
    formal Interface Control Document (ICD) that defined how partnering systems would interface 
    with the application.  Green Umbrella Software also implemented algorithms to ingest large 
    volumes of Extensible Markup Language (XML) information and transform it into an internally 
    acceptable XML schema.  
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    Green Umbrella Software's president was the first recipient of the Team Member of the Month 
    award and the first ever two time winner while on this contract for his dedication and 
    professionalism.  Our president was also the subject matter expert for the ingestion process 
    and organized monthly team meetings for the six geographically distributed teams to get 
    together and discuss issues and lessons learned.</div>
    <div>Green Umbrella Software has designed and developed an enterprise Service Oriented 
    Architecture (SOA) based software system to be used across an entire federal agency for 
    recalling inaccurate reporting.  This system is the seventh most important application 
    within this particular agency out of hundreds of software suites.  Green Umbrella Software
    designed this application to scale on demand and interface cleanly with multiple back-end 
    data repositories and automatically determine the validity of the recall and its target 
    reports.  Our firm implemented security restrictions to allow access only by authenticated 
    users and external systems while providing several interfaces to allow external systems 
    flexibility in how they interact with the application.  We designed an intuitive web based 
    interface to allow analysts the ability to search, review, and understand the reasons behind 
    the recall from anywhere in the world on any browser.  
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    Recently Green Umbrella Software's president received the prestigious Team Member of the 
    Quarter award for quarter two of fiscal year 2010.  This award covers 1300 federal contractors 
    and the president won the award after only four months on contract due to his high quality of 
    service, professionalism and ability to accept and solve various challenges. </div>
